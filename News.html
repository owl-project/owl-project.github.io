<h2 id="nov-8-2020---first-public-introduction-of-owl-on-my-blog">Nov 8, 2020 - first public “introduction” of OWL on my Blog</h2>
<p>Though OWL has been mentioned previously in various places, yesterday OWL was - for the first time - introduced as now being public, stable, and ready-to-use.</p>
<!-- ======================================================= -->
<h2 id="oct-25-30---owl-based-exabricks-paper-at-ieee-vis">Oct 25-30 - OWL-based “ExaBricks” paper at IEEE Vis</h2>
<p>This week at IEEE Vis we presented our “ExaBricks” paper on AMR data rendering, written completely in OWL: https://www.willusher.io/publications/exabrick</p>

<h2 id="oct-17-2020---first-version-1.0">Oct 17, 2020 - first “Version 1.0”</h2>
<p>After fixing the last few bugs and feature requests that stood in the way of doing so, OWL has finally been tagged as the first official, complete, stable release … V1.0</p>
<!-- ======================================================= -->
<h2 id="jan-7-2020---first-prototype-with-most-of-optix7course-obj-viewer">Jan 7, 2020 - first prototype with (most of) optix7course OBJ viewer</h2>
<p>As of just a few minutes ago, OWL has passed another milestone in that I just managed to port the course tutorial from our Siggraph 2019 course on optix 7 (<a href="https://github.com/ingowald/optix7course">original code at https://github.com/ingowald/optix7course</a>) to also work on OWL.</p>
<p>There’s still a two caveats with this code, namely that OWL does not yet that I do not yet expose denoising, and that it does not yet support a native “OWLTexture” type; both of which the final example in that course tutorial relied upon. For denoising, there was (as yet) no other way but to disable denoising in this sample; for texturing, however, I could actually use the existing CUDA based texture code, and simply upload the cudaTextureObject’s as SBT data, so texturing does actually work.</p>
<p>There were several bugs discovered in this sample, and quite a few more missing pieces than expected (eg, I had to add support for multiple ray types, multiple miss programs, variables for user types, and a lot of bug fixes); on the upside, the resulting code is (as hoped) significnatly simpler than the original one, and the current use of CUDA textures is a nice demonstration of how easy it is to do “CUDA interop”.</p>
<p>Code will need some more cleanup before release, but first sample pic here:</p>

<h2 id="dev-29-2019---v0.5.3-with-first-rtow-example-on-node-graph-layer">Dev 29, 2019 - v0.5.3 with first RTOW example on Node Graph Layer</h2>
<p>Node graph layer shows first signs of life, now supporting the full “RTOW” (<a href="https://www.realtimerendering.com/raytracing/Ray%20Tracing%20in%20a%20Weekend.pdf%5D">Ray Tracing in One Weekend</a>) sample.</p>
<p>For a (very) rough idea of how the node graph API works, see <a href="ng-api-overview.html">this brief walk-through through the <code>ng05-rtow</code> sample</a>.</p>
<!-- ======================================================= -->
<h2 id="dev-25-2019---v0.5.2-and-first-successful-app-port">Dev 25, 2019 - v0.5.2 and first successful app-port</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>v0.5.2 adds first part of node graph layer, with <code>ng01-simpleTriangles</code> example that ported <code>ll01-simpleTriangles</code> to node graph layer API (many ng parts still missing - so far only triangle geometry working)</p></li>
<li><p>successfully ported first ‘external’ app over to owl-ll: The app shown here is a pkd-tree based particle viewer initially written on OptiX 6, and now ported to OptiX 7 view the owl-ll layer. The pictures show two data sets (a ‘supersoot’ particle and a crack simulation) also referenced in <a href="http://www.sci.utah.edu/~wald/Publications/2015/pkd/pkd.pdf">http://www.sci.utah.edu/~wald/Publications/2015/pkd/pkd.pdf</a></p></li>

<h2 id="dec-19-2019---first-public-version-on-github">Dec 19, 2019 - First Public Version on Github</h2>
<ul>
<li>pushed version 0.5.0; still very early, but ll-api layer’s version of “Ray Tracing in One Weekend” working reliably on both Linux and Windows.</li>
</ul>
