# OWL - News / Updates

## Dev 25, 2019 - v0.5.2 and first successful app-port

- v0.5.2 adds first part of node graph layer, with `ng01-simpleTriangles`
  example that ported `ll01-simpleTriangles` to node graph layer API
  (many ng parts still missing - so far only triangle geometry working)
  
- successfully ported first 'external' app over to owl-ll: The app shown
  here is a pkd-tree based particle viewer initially written on OptiX 6, and
  now ported to OptiX 7 view the owl-ll layer. The pictures show two data
  sets (a 'supersoot' particle and a crack simulation) also referenced in
